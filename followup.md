## Implementation

1. What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

Tailwindcss, headlessui, heroicons for fast prototyping and good ui standarts.
Also used Typescript for better developer experince.

2. What would you change about your implementation if you had to handle thousands of items?

I would add pagination or virtual rendering. Also if i need to keep the data at the memory i would make dishes as shallow ref for better performance.

## General

1. If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

I would implement eslint, prettier, husky for code quality. 
I would implement unit tests with vitest and testing library and e2e tests with cypress.
Form validation and component states like loading, error, empty states etc.

2. Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

Clean coding. Extracted logic as much as i can and also components are divided per responsibility.
This project can grow easily without any problem

3. Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

Form and form elements. Generally it was easy

4. How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

It was nice tests to measure ones general knowledge about creating an ui and vue experience.
